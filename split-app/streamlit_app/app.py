    ### How It Works
    
    **Expense Splitter** helps groups of people split expenses fairly by:
    
    1. **Tracking expenses** - Record who paid for what
    2. **Supporting different split types**:
       - Equal splits among participants
       - Percentage splits where each person owes a specific percentage
       - Exact amount splits where specific amounts are assigned
    3. **Calculating balances** - Shows who owes money and who should receive money
    4. **Optimizing settlements** - Minimizing the number of transactions needed
    
    ### Features
    
    - **Add, edit, and delete expenses**
    - **View expenses** in a clear tabular format
    - **Split expenses** equally, by percentage, or exact amounts
    - **Calculate optimized settlements** to minimize transactions
    - **View balances** with insightful visualizations
    
    ### Technologies Used
    
    - **Frontend**: Streamlit
    - **Backend**: FastAPI
    - **Database**: MongoDB
    
    ### Made by
    
    This app was created as part of a development assignment.
