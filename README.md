## üßÆ Settlement Logic Explained

The settlement algorithm works in 3 steps:
1. Calculate net balance for each person
2. Separate into debtors (negative balance) and creditors (positive balance)
3. Use a greedy approach to clear debts with minimal transactions

Example:
- Alice: +$100 (creditor)
- Bob: -$60 (debtor)
- Charlie: -$40 (debtor)

Solution:
- Bob pays $60 to Alice
- Charlie pays $40 to Alice

## üîß Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jay-3107/devdynamics-project.git
cd split-app

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB connection string

# Run the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema
The application uses MongoDB with the following collections:

- **expenses**: Stores expense records with title, amount, payer, participants, and split information
- **balances**: Calculated balances between users (generated, not stored)
- **settlements**: Optimized transactions to settle debts (generated, not stored)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Assumptions
- **Single Currency**: Currently supports calculations in a single currency
- **No Authentication**: API doesn't implement user authentication/authorization
- **Simplified Person Model**: People are identified by name only without user accounts
- **In-memory Optimizations**: Some calculations happen in-memory rather than in the database
